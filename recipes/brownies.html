        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I know that saying these are the “best <strong>brownies</strong>, ever” is a 
            bold statement, but we truly believe it. I love brownies 
            that are rich and extra chocolaty. These <strong>brownies</strong> with dense,
            fudgy middles and crinkly tops absolutely deliver! These are 
            perfect for boxed <strong>brownie</strong> lovers — the dense, moist, and fudgy 
            texture is not all that different from what you can expect from 
            the boxed mixes. It get’s better, though. These <strong>brownies</strong> are much 
            more flavorful than anything made from a box. They taste amazing.
