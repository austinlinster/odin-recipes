        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>If you haven't heard of Slutty Brownes by now, then 
            you are completely missing out. Truly I have no idea why 
            they are called that name. It's hilarious but that's what
            everyone knows them by. This easy layered dessert is absolutely 
            delicious because it combines all the best things: cookie dough, 
            Oreo cookies and brownies. These have been one of my favorite 
            bars for a long while now and we can't stop making them. So if 
            you are looking for that perfectly easy dessert recipe to whip 
            up or to bring to a gathering, you have to try this Slutty
