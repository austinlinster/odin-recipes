        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Recipes that don’t require baking are easy and great 
            any time of year. While they are a year-round treat, 
            these peanut butter bars are especially wonderful in 
            the summer, when you don’t want to crank up your oven. 
            And with them being so quick to make, they’re perfect 
            for unexpected company or that last-minute teen request.
